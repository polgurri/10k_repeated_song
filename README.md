REPEATED SONGS $10K EMAIL '2019'; P.Gurri
------------------------------------

Not long ago, GOLD FM, a radio in Melbourne had a contest
if they repeated a song between 6am and 6pm and you call them
you would win $10.000
Here's a little script that gets the current song they are playing
via their webpage, and compares it to all the ones that have been
played. If a song has been played twice, you will get an email
telling you to call them and get those $10K!

This project requires a webdriver, I use firefox to do it as I use
chrome for my daily browsing (and this way they don't interfere)
The webdriver allows to get information even if the fields are populated via javascript

Disclaimer: I did not win! 
The few seconds between the start of the song and receiving the email were enough for other people to have called.
